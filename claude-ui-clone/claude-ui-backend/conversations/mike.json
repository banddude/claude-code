Let me look at my available tools to see if there's a Chrome MCP tool.\n\nLooking at my available tools, I don't see any MCP tools with the \"mcp__\" prefix, which means I don't currently have the Chrome MCP tool or any other MCP tools loaded in this session.\n\nMCP (Model Context Protocol) tools need to be configured and enabled separately. If you'd like to use Chrome MCP tools, they would need to be set up in your Claude Code configuration first.\n\nIs there something specific you were hoping to do with Chrome that I might be able to help with using my existing tools (like web search or web fetch)?"
